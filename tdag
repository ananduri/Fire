(Get blackbody color from temperature value)

(Convert HSV or HSL to RGB)

(Implement time evolution/stepping of particles
  (Also use FMM to get the temp, which depends on all other particles)  
  )

(Make a macro/template for squaring functions. pow will be slow)

(Implement fast function pixel -> color
  (Use FMM (Fast Multipole Method) to calculate the contribution from each particle)
  )


(Consider "negative" charges/energies?)


(Could create a cool ASCII representation of the quadtree and print it out in unit tests)
